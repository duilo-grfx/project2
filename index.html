				<h1>University of Kostin Co-op Program</h1>
				<p>Welcome to the Team Rochester website! We’ve partnered up with the
           	 University of Kostin to create a Co-op program for students in
            different areas of studies including Natural Science, Social
            Science, and Humanities. In the Co-op program, students will have
            the opportunity to travel to a different City in North America and be able to
            temporarily work for a company and do research in areas related to
            their major. This will assist students from the University of Kostin
            to gain experience in their fields before graduating with their
            Bachelor’s Degree. To qualify for our Co-op program, students must
            have at least a 2.7 Overall GPA and a Junior. The Cities/Countries
            that we offer are New Orleans, Louisiana, USA; Toronto, Ontario, Canada; New York
            City, New York, USA; and San Franscisco, California, USA. On our website feel
            free to explore the information of the different cities if you
            believe one of them is the location for you! Click on the name of each city to learn more about what is has</p>
