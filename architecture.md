## Choreography
- The method that will be used to organize the content is location, the cities will be organized beginning in the northernmost city moving south. This will give some structure to the content as it is likely that location will be influential in some features of the cities (such as geography and climate and thus other factors such as tourism) The information itself will be categorically organized, that is information relating to a certain feature about the city will be placed within that section to maintain an organized structure to the page.
